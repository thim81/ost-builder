## Why it exists

Many product managers are familiar with Opportunity Solution Trees through Teresa Torres’ *Continuous Discovery Habits*, but applying them in practice can still be challenging. While the concept is powerful, working with templates and slides (like Miro or decks) often feels time‑consuming tweaking to make it look good when all you want is a clear, readable OST.

After Hustle Badger’s examples made the structure finally click for me, the remaining gap was tooling. I wanted something lightweight and fast, allowing to focus on thinking instead of formatting.

With OST-builder I can type Markdown or add Opportunities/Solutions directly, share it with teammates, and call it a day. And because it’s Markdown, it works great with AI assistants & LLMs too.

This project is open‑source and free — my small way to give back to the PM community. Feedback is very welcome.

## Who it’s for

- Product Managers practicing continuous discovery
- Product teams using Opportunity Solution Trees
- Anyone who prefers lightweight, text-first tools over whiteboards
